HOME is a platform/puzzle game that utilizes blocks, portals, ladders, elevators, and ladders to create a path for the user to travel through and enjoy. 
HOME is about a young character who is lost and trying to find her way back home, however as she enters into a world where acidic rain falls down, the only thing protecting her is her pink umbrella. 
Thus, the objective of the game is for the player to guide this lost character back home in a certain amount of time before her umbrella fades away and the rain slowly kills her. 
Along the way, the character is lured into possible charging stations that can charge itâ€™s umbrella, however as symbol for society's reliance on electronics. 
Eventually the character realizes that she's lost in this addiction but instead finds that the real source of energy is through hard work and talent. 
In HOME, the player can maneuver around by floating and jumping onto blocks and climbing up ladders onto blocks that are not jumpable. 
There are also portals. 
Thus, the user must move throughout this world and jump onto the right blocks and paths until they make it back HOME.
